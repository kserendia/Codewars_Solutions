Welcome to ma pizza shop!
I hava the bigga spherical blob of dough.
And I wanna squisha ma dough to a circle to maka ma famous pizza base!
You just choosa the "crispy" crust or the "thick" crust.
So, how bigga ma pizza gonna be?
Input
blob = my dough blob diameter
crust = "crispy" or "thick"
Output
Pizza radius
Notes
All data is valid
Blob diameter is >= 0
Input/Output units are same
The "crispy" crust pizzas are 1 unit deep
The "thick" crust pizzas are 5 units deep
Near enough is good enough. If your answer is correct withn 0.001 then the test should pass.

Solution:
function howBiggaMaPizza(blob, crust) {
  let radius = blob / 2;
  let volume = (4 /3) * Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 3);
  let r;
  if (crust === 'crispy'){
    r = Math.sqrt(volume / Math.PI * 1);
  }else {
    r = Math.sqrt(volume / (Math.PI * 5));
  }
  return r;
}
