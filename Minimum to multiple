Given two integers a and x, return the minimum non-negative number to add to / subtract from a to make it a multiple of x.

minimum(10, 6)  //= 2

10+2 = 12 which is a multiple of 6
Note
0 is always a multiple of x
Constraints
1 <= a <= 106

1 <= x <= 105

Solution 1:

function minimum(a, x) {
  return Math.min(a % x, x - a % x)
}


Solution 2:

const minimum = (a, x) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < x; i++) {
    if ((a - i) % x === 0 || (a + i) % x === 0) {
      return i;
    }
  }  
}
